<h1>Machine Vision Based Object Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques</h1>
CNN is a popular deep learning approach for image categorization and identification tasks.
CNN extracts features from input images to categorize them into multiple groups or categories.
The resolution of the input image affects how CNN perceives it as an array or matrix.
Convolution layer is used to extract features from input images.
A kernel or filter is multiplied with an image matrix to produce the convolved feature or feature map.
Non-linear functions like ReLU are used to introduce nonlinearity to the convolution network.
Pooling layers decrease the complexity of large images by reducing their spatial dimension.
The output of the pooling layer is used to build a fully connected layer.
